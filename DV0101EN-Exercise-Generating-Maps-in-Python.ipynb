To do that, we will part ways with Matplotlib and work with another Python visualization library, namely **Folium**. What is nice about **Folium** is that it was developed for the sole purpose of visualizing geospatial data. While other libraries are available to visualize geospatial data, such as **plotly**, they might have a cap on how many API calls you can make within a defined time frame. **Folium**, on the other hand, is completely free.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"75e2a1d4-d69b-4984-807f-138e642500b1","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["## Table of Contents\n","\n","<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\" style=\"margin-top: 20px\">\n","\n","1.
